<h1>Setting up</h1>
All you need to do to set up is install python 3 and run the command "pip install Pillow"

<h1>Running</h1>
Run the "main.py" file

<h1>Examples</h1>
<h2>Example 1</h1>
The file name for example 1 is "img.timg" and it should output an image that appears to be a black haircomb

<h2>Example 2</h2>
The file name for example 2 is "img2.timg" and the output should be four gradients

<h2>Example 3</h2>
The file name for example 3 is "img3.timg" and the output should be four long lines that are white, red, green, and blue

<h2>Big Example</h2>
The file name for this example is "big.timg" and the output is bigger than the constructor (big.timg)

<h2>Random Example</h2>
The file name for this one is "randomLine.timg" and it produces four lines of a random colour

<h1>TImg Documentation</h1>
(You can use any text editor you want for this)

<h2>File Set up</h2>
At the beginning of the file you will need to type 3 lines.
<br>
Those lines are:
<br>
"width(" then your wanted width
<br>
"height(" then your wanted height
<br>
and "setupDone" to complete the set up

<h2>COLOURS!!!</h2>
There are 4 drawing functions:
<br>
"line(" and then your length (Draws a line of your wanted length)
<br>
"down" is used to move down a line (This is needed if you are drawing on an image with a height more than 1)
<br>
"colour(" is used to change a colour (You must use a hex value without # such as "colour(FF0000" which would be red)
<br>
and "random(" sets the colour to a random colour

<h2>Writing but easier for me to code</h2>
"binary(" and then your binary text without spaces or it wont work (it makes a line of pixels with white being 1 and black meaning 0)
